Hi! I'm Supersonic, developer of some Rivals of Aether mods.. and hopefully more stuff in the future. If you're a regular in the community, you might know me for the **Abyss Rune Buddy**, or for **Abyss Hime**. Welcome to my Github Profile, I guess.


### My ongoing projects:
- Rokesha (OC belonging to [The Slugger/Sakamoto4](https://twitter.com/rau_derek), code)
- Katsu (OC belonging to [Sprite_Star0](https://twitter.com/Sprite_Star0), code)
- 2B (character from Nier Automata, pod code)
- Lumi (OC, sprites, code)

This place is kind of a barren wasteland at the moment. My current plans are:
- [x] contemplate making a general roa example repo. still thinking about it.
